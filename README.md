# electrux
An attempt to get electron and redux together for functional-hotload-web-desktop-awesomeness

# purpose

Web based desktop apps powered by frameworks like [electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) are awesome

Functional reactive programming is fun and makes it very easy for you to empower your development environment with tools like hot reloading, record/playback, etc. 
Among the several tools/frameworks/libraries/transpilers for FRP, I've found redux (https://github.com/gaearon/redux) quite nice.

This is a sandbox to learn how to connect electron with redux, and provide a state of the art development environment on the desktop experience.

I want to create examples that do something that really belongs to the desktop world. So, something that uses peripherals (like USB port reading, etc.) 
and not just an app that could be sitting on a page and added to your desktop with a launcher icon.
